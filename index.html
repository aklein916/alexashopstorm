        <h2> Why Alexa </h2>
        <p id='aboutlexi'>
          Throughout my three and a half years with lululemon athletica I wore many hats. I hired and trained store employees, managed the store's budget, developed strategies to meet ambitious quarterly goals, and planned large-scale community events. As a result, at ShopStorm I am excited to jump into new projects, such as marketing or partnership efforts, that will expose me to other areas of the business. However, in all my positions the number one priority was ensuring exceptional customer experience. I enjoyed connecting with customers and community members, and sharing my knowledge of lululemon and my dedication to its culture. Passion is contagious: I will share my passion for ShopStorm as I implement and develop successful processes to resolve customers' issues and advocate for customers' needs. At lululemon I was involved in complex business decisions. As a result, I appreciate flexibility, organization and teamwork. I am open to feedback at all levels, take ownership of my work, and value my colleagues. Consequently, I am proud of my accomplishments and I eagerly learn from my mistakes. </p>
          <p id=aboutlexi>I recently completed General Assemblyâ€™s twelve-week <a  class ="GA" href='https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive' target='_blank'> full-stack web development course. </a> The curriculum covered many programming tools, languages and processes. My greatest take-away was learning to think like a developer, both strategically and creatively. My acquired skills, including HTML/CSS and web development best practices, combined with my ability to communicate with engineers and people of varying skill levels, will allow me to create documentation that is technical yet easy to understand. I am also to learn new skills and technologies, and I want to work somewhere that recognizes that value of employee development and growth. I will combine my interpersonal and analytical skills to learn, lead, collaborate challenge, and inspire myself and others.</p>
          <p id=aboutlexi>In my networks of friends, family members and colleagues I am often the "connector." I value my relationships, keep in close contact with the people in my life and always follow through with my professional and personal responsibilities. I will provide exceptional support by doing what I do best; connecting with and helping people each and every day.

        <h2>Customer Support</h2>
        <p id='customer'>
          Exceptional Customer Support does not always involve saying "yes". However, a direct "no" is not effective. Communication is critical: When I listen to a customer's concerns I can understand the root of the problem and find a solution that makes the customer happy and does not undermine the company's best practices. Because while the customer is not always right, the customer is never wrong, either. The solution to any problem starts with listening and managing expectations.
        </p>
        <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
        <h3>1. PRE-SALES </h3>
        <p> If a customer emailed me this questions, my response would be honest and curious. I would tell the customer that while we don't yet offer the feature, we understand that it is important to them. Additionally, I would find and suggest a way that our service could do something similar to the live image preveiew. I would offer to help the customer through the process. Finally, I would ask the customer how else I can support them. I want the customer to feel valued, heard and understood. I would thank them for being a valued customer and I would make myself available to them anytime. I believe exceptional customer service can win over features, and I would provide a "wow" experience each and every time.
        </p>
        <h3> 2. FIRE ALARM </h3>
        <p> When there is a large scale problem, my first step is to quickly read through the customer concerns and gain an understanding of the problem. My next step is to reply to all customers and let them know that I understand there is a problem and I am working to resolve it quickly and effectively. Communication is key, and I want the customers to know that my top priority is making them happy. I will then work with the necessary teams to fix the issue, and I will let the customers know immediately when the issue is resolved.
        </p>
        <h3> 3. STEP-BY-STEP </h3>
        <p> The last thing I purchased online was a wedding gift for a friend. I wanted to choose something personal. I remembered I had seen a Maine-based company, <a href='http://www.fiberandwater.com'> Fiber and Water </a> at an art fair in Boston. My friend and her husband are from Colorado, but currently live in Virginia. I chose two pieces of art that will remind them of home and their beautiful Ranch wedding in Colorado. And they travel well! I love buying gifts for others, and I take great pride in picking out unique gifts or experiences that I can gift to the people in my life. It speaks to my passion for creating exceptional experiences for others, whether people I know or customers I help. I will apply the same level of thoughtfulness to every conversation I have working at ShopStorm that I did to picking this gift for my friend.
